UWB ACM Spring 2023 Hacakthon

This project was created over the span of a weekend for the UWB ACM Hackathon (https://uwb-acm-hacks-in-person.devpost.com/).

We chose the Sustainability track:

How can we ensure people are being environmentally conscious when engaging in outdoor, in-person activities again? Create solutions to maintain and promote sustainability now that gatherings and events are moving in person.

Purpose
The purpose of this website is to provide the user some quick environmental information that relate to the location they desire to go to. Each criteria, electrictiy consumptiopn, air quality, and CO2 messions, will have a circle that will either be green for good, yellow for normal, and red for bad. 

We use public APIs to query the data for each location that is desired in Javascript, and use HTML/CSS to format the user interface.
